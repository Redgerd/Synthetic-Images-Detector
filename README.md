# Image Authenticity Detector
The quality of AI-generated images has rapidly increased, leading to concerns of authenticity and trustworthiness.

## Project Overview

The **Image Authenticity Detector** is a machine learning project that aims to distinguish between real and AI-generated images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This project utilizes a discriminator model built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify images as either real (0) or fake (1). The discriminator is trained on a dataset of real and AI-generated images to improve its accuracy in detecting authenticity.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can find it at the following link:

[CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/dima806/cifake-ai-generated-image-detection-vit](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images))

CIFAKE is a dataset that contains 60,000 synthetically-generated images and 60,000 real images (collected from CIFAR-10). Can computer vision techniques be used to detect when an image is real or has been generated by AI?
